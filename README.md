# Idea

People create and publish nuggets of wisdom and share them online e.g. Twitter/Instagram/Facebook. My goal is to provide a way to incentivize it to appreciate the creators. 

# What is the current problem

## Content

Everyone has something to say and share their wisdom but there is no simple platform to create content and provide incentives. 

### Current solutions 

1. Write content.
2. Publish it through Amazon or Gumroad or a similar platform.
3. Then monetize it through a different platform.

The main problem with approach work/reward is not very much and no one can do it consistently. 

# What I am going to solve

1) Provide a simple way to upload content.
2) Platform will show an ad to end user in order to view this content.
3) All ad revenue will go to creator.

Happy creators and consumer!!!!!
