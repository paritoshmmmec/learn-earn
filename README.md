# Idea

People create and publish nuggets of wisdom and share them online e.g. Twitter/Instagram/Facebook. My goal is to provide a way to incentivize it to appreciate the creators. 

# What is the current problem

## Content

Everyone has something to say and share their wisdom but there is no simple platform to create content and provide incentives. 

### Current solutions 

1. Write content.
2. Publish it through Amazon or Gumroad or a similar platform.
3. Then monetize it through a different platform.

3) All ad revenue will go to creator.

Happy creators and consumer!!!!!
